# Simple-Social-Network
One-file social network written fully by cursor.sh &amp; gpt4 in one hour. Easy mysql setup + real time chats and more!

# Setup:
1. Change mysql database credentials in both files
2. Simple open localhost/index.php?setup&pwd=admin in browser to setup database tables
3. All set! There is no admin system :)

# Features:
+ Realtime messaging
+ Profile viewing / description
+ Easy database setup

This project was done while testing the new IDE https://cursor.sh/. In my experience regular chat with gpt4 works much better than the built-in chat in this IDE :/
It may also contain vulnerabilities since the whole code was written by a neural network, but I didn't find any. You are free to use this code as you wish! I think someone could use it for a school project.
